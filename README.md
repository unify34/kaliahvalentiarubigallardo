my daughters, I love you so very much. you mean the world to me. your mothers only did what they thought was best for you, by no means did they intentionally kidnap you, yet they did.

  <h1>Or</h1><p>
  Maybe they DID <i>intentionally</i><p>
    
    Questions you should ask your mother. The time we've never shared was because she never afforded that to you. At any given moment she could of brought you but she didnt. <p> Think about it my babies. <p>
